## Local development

The stack comes up on its own. A one-shot `migrate` service applies the Prisma
schema before the API and worker start, so there is no manual migration step.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Required: SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
docker compose up -d
```

Verify:

```bash
curl -s localhost:3001/health
# {"status":"healthy","database":"connected","environment":"development",...}
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Dashboard | http://localhost:3000 |
| API | http://localhost:3001 |
| Health | http://localhost:3001/health |

The `migrate` container exits 0 once the schema is applied. That is expected:

```bash
docker compose ps          # migrate shows "Exited (0)"
docker compose logs migrate
```

Behind a mirror or proxy, pass the registry at build time:

```bash
docker compose build --build-arg NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.example.com
```

Running services outside Docker instead:

```bash
npm install
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:generate
npm run dev
```

## Production, single host

`docker-compose.prod.yml` adds NGINX for TLS termination and restart policies.
It expects certificates already present at `nginx/ssl/`.

### 1. Host preparation

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"   # log out and back in
```

### 2. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dsk-dev-ai/api-monitor-saas.git
cd api-monitor-saas
cp .env.example .env
```

Set at minimum:

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Production PostgreSQL. This one URL serves the host tooling and the containers here, so no `DATABASE_URL_DOCKER` is needed. |
| `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Authentication |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `openssl rand -base64 48` |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Public frontend origin, used for CORS |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Public API base URL including `/api/v1` |

Optional, feature-gated: `STRIPE_*` with `ENABLE_BILLING=true`, `RESEND_API_KEY`
and `FROM_EMAIL` with `ENABLE_EMAILS=true`.

### 3. TLS certificates

```bash
sudo mkdir -p nginx/ssl
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/<your-domain>/* nginx/ssl/
```

Then adjust `nginx/nginx.conf` for your domain. The committed config is a
reference and expects certificates at those paths.

### 4. Start

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
```

Confirm the health endpoint reports a connected database before pointing DNS at
the host.

```

The API and frontend scale horizontally because they are stateless. **The worker
must run as exactly one replica** — see
[known limitations](#known-production-limitations).

---

## Managed platform, combined container

The root `Dockerfile` builds the API and worker into a single image for hosts
that bill per container. `docker/start-combined.sh` runs both processes.

`render.yaml` is a ready import for Render's free tier. The free tier sleeps
after roughly 15 minutes of inactivity, and `.github/workflows/keep-alive.yml`
pings `/health` every 5 minutes to prevent that.

For Vercel or similar, deploy `frontend/` as a standalone Next.js application.
Note that the worker cannot run there — a persistent background process is
required for monitoring to continue.

---

## Updating a deployment

```bash
cd /opt/api-monitor
git pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

`scripts/deploy.sh` wraps this sequence. Migrations apply automatically via the
`migrate` service, which both application services wait on. Check its exit
status after a release that includes schema changes:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs migrate
```

---

## Backup and restore

`scripts/backup.sh` runs `pg_dump`. Schedule it with cron or a systemd timer.

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh
```

Restoring is currently manual. There is no automated restore path, no
point-in-time recovery, and no replication configuration in this repository.

```bash
gunzip -c backup.sql.gz | psql "$DATABASE_URL"
```

Test a restore before you need one. An untested backup is not a backup.

---

## Troubleshooting

### `Prisma cannot find the required libssl system library`

The image is missing OpenSSL, which the query engine links against at runtime.
Every backend and worker stage installs it. If you hit this on a custom image,
add:

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends openssl ca-certificates \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

The same error appears if `binaryTargets` in `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` is
pinned to a platform other than the one running. Leave it as `["native"]`.

### `The table public.checks does not exist`

Migrations have not run. Confirm the `migrate` service succeeded:

```bash
docker compose logs migrate
```

Apply them by hand if needed:

```bash
docker compose exec backend npx prisma migrate deploy --schema prisma/schema.prisma
```

### `next: not found` in the frontend

The bind mount at `./frontend:/app` is shadowing the image's `node_modules`. The
anonymous volume on `/app/node_modules` prevents this; removing it reintroduces
the fault.

### Backend reports `database: disconnected`

Almost always `DATABASE_URL` pointing at `localhost`, which does not resolve
inside the compose network. Use the `postgres` service name and port 5432, or
set `DATABASE_URL_DOCKER`.

### Duplicate alerts for a single outage

More than one worker replica is running. Last-check state is per-process, so
every replica probes and alerts independently. Scale the worker to exactly one
until the Redis-backed queue lands.

### Build fails fetching packages

A registry mirror is unreachable. The Dockerfiles default to the public npm
registry and accept an override:

```bash
docker compose build --build-arg NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.example.com
```

### Worker exits immediately on startup

Check the logs. Common causes are an unreachable database or a missing
`SUPABASE_*` value. In development the worker has `restart: unless-stopped` and
recovers on its own; in production, investigate rather than relying on restarts.

---

## Known production limitations

These are real constraints of the current implementation, not oversights.

| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Worker cannot scale past one replica | Duplicate probes and alerts | Keep `replicas: 1`. Requires the Redis queue in `ROADMAP.md` (P1) |
| No job queue, retry, or backoff | A failed probe is recorded, not retried | Monitor for gaps; queue work is in `ROADMAP.md` (P1) |
| Worker state is in memory | Status transitions can be lost across a restart | State is rehydrated from recent `Check` rows at boot; narrow the window by avoiding restarts |
| `SIGTERM` does not drain | At most one batch of in-flight checks is lost on shutdown | Results are written per monitor, so partial loss is bounded |
| No automated restore | Recovery is manual | Test restores on a schedule |
| Single-host topology | No multi-node failover | Use a managed platform if high availability is required |
| Unbounded retention sweep | A single `deleteMany` can lock a large `Check` table | Keep `CLEANUP_DAYS` modest; batching is in `ROADMAP.md` (P1) |
