/**
 * Perform one HTTP request that cannot be redirected by the HTTP client.
 *
 * `maxRedirects: 0` makes axios use Node's native `http`/`https` transport instead of
 * `follow-redirects`, so the only destination this can reach is the one in `target`.
 * The agents carry a guarded `lookup` so the address dialled is the address that was
 * classified, which is what prevents a name from being re-resolved to something else
 * between the check and the connection.
 *
 * A fresh agent pair is built per request. Agents pool sockets, and a pooled socket
 * would be reused for a destination whose policy decision was made earlier in the
 * cycle; `keepAlive: false` keeps each attempt's decision bound to that attempt.
 *
 * The response is requested as a stream and is never handed back in buffered form.
 * The default `responseType` collects the entire body into `response.data` before the
 * promise settles, which means a target can decide how much memory this worker uses
 * and how long it waits. Streaming moves that decision to the executor, which caps it.
