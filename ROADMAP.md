# Roadmap

Planned work. **Nothing in this file is implemented.** For what actually exists today, read
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and the feature matrix in [README.md](README.md).

Ordered by priority, not by release. Items marked **P0** are correctness, security, or
reliability problems that affect the current system.

---

## P0 — Correctness and security

These are defects or gaps in shipped code, not feature requests.

### SSRF protection in the monitoring worker

**Status:** not implemented · **Severity:** high

Users supply arbitrary URLs that the worker fetches on their behalf. There is no destination
validation, so a monitor can be pointed at `127.0.0.1`, the `10.0.0.0/8` and `172.16.0.0/12`
private ranges, the Docker host gateway, or cloud metadata endpoints such as
`169.254.169.254`. A user can use the worker as a proxy to probe internal infrastructure.

Required:

- Resolve the hostname and reject private, loopback, link-local, and reserved ranges
- Re-check the resolved address at connect time to block DNS rebinding
- Enforce an allow/deny list for operators
- Restrict redirect following, or re-validate every redirect hop
- Cap response body size to prevent memory exhaustion

### Test suite is effectively empty

**Status:** 2 test files, 178 lines · **Severity:** high

The worker and frontend have no tests and CI runs with `--passWithNoTests`, so a fully broken
suite still reports green. Required: unit coverage for `executeCheck` and the alert
state machine, integration coverage for the monitor and billing routes against real
postgres and Redis, and an end-to-end path covering signup through incident to alert.

### Multi-replica worker causes duplicate checks

**Status:** by design limitation · **Severity:** medium

Last-check timestamps live in a per-process `Map`, so the interval filter has no cross-process
view. Two worker replicas issue duplicate probes and duplicate alerts. The system is
correct only at exactly one worker instance, and nothing enforces that. Scaling horizontally
requires moving scheduling state into Redis.

### Status transitions lost on worker restart

**Status:** partial mitigation · **Severity:** medium

Status history is rehydrated from the most recent `Check` per monitor at boot, which is the
right idea but uses `findMany` with `distinct` and no `orderBy` guarantee per group. A monitor
that went down and recovered entirely within the restart window produces no alert.

### Row Level Security not enabled

**Status:** not implemented · **Severity:** medium

All tenancy enforcement is in application code. A single query bug in a route handler exposes
cross-tenant data. Enabling RLS would make the database the backstop.

---

## P1 — Reliability

### Redis-backed job queue

**Status:** dependency present, integration absent · **Severity:** high

`bullmq` and `ioredis` are declared in `worker/package.json` and a Redis service runs in
Compose, but no code path imports either. Scheduling is `setInterval` plus an in-process `Map`.

Required: BullMQ queue and worker, exponential backoff, retry with attempt ceilings,
dead-letter queue, job idempotency keys, graceful drain on shutdown, and a queue-depth admin
view. This single change resolves the multi-replica duplication problem, the lost-transition
problem, and the no-retry problem together.

### Retention and storage growth

`Check` rows accumulate at the full probe rate. The daily sweep deletes rows older than
`CLEANUP_DAYS` (default 90) with a single unbounded `deleteMany`, which can lock and balloon
the WAL on a large table. Required: batched deletion, a covering index on `checkedAt`, and
optional downsampling of old checks into hourly or daily aggregates.

### Health and observability beyond `/health`

`GET /health` checks database and Redis reachability and nothing else. Required: worker
liveness and heartbeat age, queue depth and oldest-job age, error rate and p95 latency,
structured log shipping, and Prometheus-format metrics.

### Graceful shutdown does not drain

`SIGTERM` disconnects Prisma and exits immediately, abandoning any in-flight batch. Required:
stop accepting new work, await in-flight probes up to a deadline, then exit.

---

## P2 — Self-hosted authentication

**Status:** not implemented · **Severity:** high for self-hosting

Auth is delegated to Supabase. `docker compose up` does not produce a working login without a
Supabase project and keys, which blocks fully offline deployment and air-gapped installs.

Required: email/password with verification, password reset, session and refresh-token
rotation stored in the application database, account management, and migration from existing
Supabase accounts. `bcryptjs` and `jsonwebtoken` are already dependencies. Enterprise SSO
(SAML and OIDC) sits on top of this and is a separate item below.

---

## P3 — Organization and access control

### Workspaces and teams

**Status:** placeholder pages only · **Severity:** medium

`frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/team/page.tsx` and `workspaces/page.tsx` render without backing
API or data model.

Required: `Organization`, `Workspace`, and `Membership` tables; a workspace scoping layer over
the existing `userId`-owned models; member invitations with expiry; and per-workspace
monitor, alert, and status-page isolation.

### RBAC

**Status:** not implemented · **Severity:** medium

Authorization is owner-scoped only. Required: `Owner`, `Admin`, `Member`, `Viewer` roles, a
permission model such as `monitor.read` / `monitor.create` / `monitor.update` /
`monitor.delete` / `incident.manage` / `team.manage` / `billing.manage`, and server-side
enforcement on every route. Hiding controls in the UI is not enforcement.

### Audit log

**Status:** not implemented · **Severity:** medium

Required: an append-only `AuditEvent` table capturing actor, workspace, action, resource,
resource ID, timestamp, and source IP, with an admin query UI. Expected by any organization
running shared infrastructure.

---

## P4 — Alerting and communication

### Multi-channel notification engine

**Status:** email only, hardcoded · **Severity:** medium

The worker calls `sendEmailAlert` directly on status change. There is no provider abstraction
and no per-monitor channel configuration.

Required: a `NotificationProvider` interface with Email, Slack, generic webhook, and SMS
adapters; per-monitor channel selection; retry and backoff per channel; and delivery
attempts recorded against the alert.

### Alert improvements

Maintenance-window suppression, threshold configuration beyond binary up/down, flapping
detection, and configurable escalation policy.

---

## P5 — Status pages and incidents

### Status page management UI

**Status:** API and public view only · **Severity:** medium

CRUD endpoints and the public `/status/[slug]` page work. There is no editor for composing a
page, attaching monitors, or publishing. Required: builder UI, component grouping, and
customization.

### Incident management

**Status:** not implemented · **Severity:** medium

Alerts are individual rows with no grouping, no operator acknowledgement workflow beyond a
single PATCH, and no postmortem field. Required: first-class `Incident` aggregating the checks
and alerts that constitute an outage, `Investigating` / `Identified` / `Monitoring` /
`Resolved` lifecycle, and status-page propagation.

### Maintenance windows

Scheduled suppression that prevents false alerts during planned downtime, and displays
maintenance state on the public status page.

---

## P6 — Billing and entitlements

**Status:** backend only · **Severity:** medium

Stripe checkout, portal, and webhooks are implemented server-side. The frontend billing page
does not complete a purchase, and plan limits are advisory rather than enforced.

Required: complete checkout UI, plan-to-entitlement mapping, server-side enforcement of
monitor count and check-interval limits, a quota-exhaustion path, webhook-driven subscription
state reconciliation, and invoice history.

---

## P7 — Scale and operations

Ordered by value, not by effort. None of this is needed for a single-host deployment.

- Read replicas or a dedicated analytics store as `Check` volume grows
- Regional probe execution, which the `region` field on `Check` already anticipates
- Horizontal API scaling, which is safe today only because the API is stateless
- Bulk import and export of monitors
- Monitor templates and folders
- Synthetic multi-step transaction checks
- TLS certificate management and automated renewal for self-hosted installs
- Kubernetes or Swarm manifests, if multi-host deployment becomes a real requirement

---

## Explicitly not planned

Recording these so they are not mistaken for oversights:

- **Mobile app.** No evidence of demand, and it would consume the whole roadmap.
- **CLI tool.** `curl` against the API covers the same ground today.
- **AI assistant.** Would add an external model dependency to a monitoring tool that should
  fail predictably.
- **Microservice decomposition.** Three services is the right size for this workload.
